# startup - Ranker
I want to make a site that could be used for ranked voting or polls. This could be used in anything ranging from a team making decisions on some proposed plans for a project, to influencers using it as a fun way to interact with their audience. The term "ranked polls" is meant to indicate more of a voting system than a poll. Participants would choose multiple options and either through a point system, or by elimination of less popular options, a winner would be decided. A limitation of a free version could be the number of active polls non-owners can see and interact with.<br><br>
